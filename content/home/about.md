Ubiquitous sensing in human spaces is rapidly becoming a fact of
  life. Large collections of IoT devices feed a vast sensing
  infrastructure that records and analyzes personal and private
  information. Maintaining privacy in the future without hamstringing
  the utility of IoT-derived data is a key practical and research
  challenge. In contrast to one-size-fits-all legal privacy frameworks
  like GDPR and CCPA, we envision a new legal-technical framework
  called the Privacy Backplane that enables individuals to specify and
  control the policies governing how information gathered about them
  is accessed, used, and stored. The legal framework mandates that IoT
  environments negotiate clear policies with individuals about how
  data collected by IoT devices about them can be used, and then
  enforces those policies.  The technical framework implements such
  negotiation and enforcement, and certifies that the policies are
  followed. In effect, this can be viewed as the inverse of classic
  DRM: individuals are the content producers, and have knowledge of
  and control over the policies applied to their information.
